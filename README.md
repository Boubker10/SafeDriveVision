# SafeDriveVision

## Project Description
SafeDriveVision is a computer vision project aimed at enhancing road safety. This project leverages deep learning models to detect and alert in real-time the dangerous behaviors of drivers, such as using a phone while driving or showing signs of drowsiness. The primary goal is to help reduce road accidents by alerting drivers to their potentially hazardous actions.

## Features
- **Phone Use Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv5 model to identify drivers using their phones during driving.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Incorporates a custom detector (sharp detector) to monitor signs of driver fatigue.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Implements an alert system that warns the driver when a risky behavior is detected.


## Requierments

- PyTorch >= 0.4.1 (PyTorch v1.1.0 is tested successfully.)

- Python >= 3.6 (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib)

- Dlib 
- OpenCV (Python version, for image IO operations.)
- Cython (For accelerating depth and PNCC render.)




## ðŸ§© Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the repository:** :
```
git clone https://github.com/Boubker10/SafeDriveVision
```
3. **Install the necessary dependencies:** :
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Download the YOLOv5 checkpoint file (`yolov5m.pt`)**:

    Before running the project, make sure to download the YOLOv5 model checkpoint file `yolov5m.pt` from the official repository. You can download it [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v5.0/yolov5m.pt).
