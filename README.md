# SafeDriveVision

## Project Description
SafeDriveVision is a computer vision project aimed at enhancing road safety. This project leverages deep learning models to detect and alert in real-time the dangerous behaviors of drivers, such as using a phone while driving or showing signs of drowsiness. The primary goal is to help reduce road accidents by alerting drivers to their potentially hazardous actions.

To read a detailed explanation of the SafeDriveVision project, check out the article on Medium: [SafeDriveVision: Enhancing Road Safety through Computer Vision](https://medium.com/@boubkerbennani44/safedrivevision-enhancing-road-safety-through-computer-vision-d0db5f75ebe9)


## Features
- **Phone Use Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv5 model to identify drivers using their phones during driving.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Incorporates a custom detector (sharp detector) to monitor signs of driver fatigue.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Implements an alert system that warns the driver when a risky behavior is detected.


## Requierments

- PyTorch >= 0.4.1 (PyTorch v1.1.0 is tested successfully.)

- Python >= 3.6 (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib)

- Dlib 
- OpenCV (Python version, for image IO operations.)
- Cython (For accelerating depth and PNCC render.)

# FaceBoxesNet Architecture

## Description
FaceBoxesNet is a neural network architecture designed for object detection. Below is the detailed description of its layers:

**Phase**: Can be either 'train' or 'test'.

**Conv1**: CRelu with 3 input channels, 24 output channels, kernel size 7x7, stride 4, padding 3.

**Pooling**: Max pooling with kernel size 3x3, stride 2, padding 1.

**Conv2**: CRelu with 48 input channels, 64 output channels, kernel size 5x5, stride 2, padding 2.

**Pooling**: Max pooling with kernel size 3x3, stride 2, padding 1.

**Inception**: Three consecutive Inception blocks.

**Detection Source 1**: Output after the Inception blocks.

**Conv3_1**: BasicConv2d with 128 input channels, 128 output channels, kernel size 1x1.

**Conv3_2**: BasicConv2d with 128 input channels, 256 output channels, kernel size 3x3, stride 2, padding 1.

**Detection Source 2**: Output after Conv3_2.

**Conv4_1**: BasicConv2d with 256 input channels, 128 output channels, kernel size 1x1.

**Conv4_2**: BasicConv2d with 128 input channels, 256 output channels, kernel size 3x3, stride 2, padding 1.

**Detection Source 3**: Output after Conv4_2.

**Multibox Layers**: Localization and classification layers applied to the detection sources.

## Inception Module

**Branch1x1**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 1x1.

**Branch1x1_2**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 1x1 after pooling.

**Branch3x3_reduce**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 1x1.

**Branch3x3**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 3x3.

**Branch3x3_reduce_2**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 1x1.

**Branch3x3_2**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 3x3.

**Branch3x3_3**: BasicConv2d with kernel size 3x3.

## BasicConv2d Module
2D Convolution followed by BatchNorm and ReLU.

## CRelu Module
2D Convolution followed by BatchNorm and concatenation of the output with its negative, then ReLU.
